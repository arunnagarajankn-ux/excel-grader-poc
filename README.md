# Excel Grader (POC)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** project focused on building an **Excel Grader** using **React**.  
The goal was to explore and evaluate different approaches for handling **spreadsheet** and **grid-based requirements** in React applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Spreadsheet/Grid Libraries**:
  - Silevis React Grid  
  - React-Spreadsheet  
  - IgniteUI-React-Spreadsheet  
  - Handsontable  

## 🚀 Key Contributions
- Developed **Excel grader components** for React.  
- Compared libraries based on:
  - Functionalities  
  - Ease of integration  
  - Suitability for real-time use cases  
- Built POCs for each approach, showcasing strengths and limitations.  

## 📖 Outcomes
- Broadened understanding of **React ecosystem tools** for handling complex **spreadsheet and UI needs**.  
- Identified trade-offs between lightweight libraries vs. feature-rich enterprise solutions.  

## 🎯 Status
This project is a **POC** and not a production-ready application. It served as a technical exploration to evaluate the **best-fit solution** for grid/spreadsheet-based UI requirements.
